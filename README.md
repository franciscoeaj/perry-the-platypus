# perry-the-platypus
Just another super secret project

## Starting the app
Basically all you need to get the api module up and then the web module up. To do so, run the following commands (assuming you're on the root folder of this project):

```cd api
yarn
yarn start
cd ../web
yarn
yarn start```


## Future work
Put the web and api modules on a docker config (maybe play a bit with k8s for personal experience) file to use them as separate microservices
