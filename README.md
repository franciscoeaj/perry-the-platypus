Just another super secret project

## Starting the app
basically, you need to get the api module up and then the web module up
to do so, run the following commands (assuming you're on the root folder of this project)
`cd api`
`yarn`
`yarn start`

`cd ../web`
`yarn`
`yarn start`

## Future work
put the web and api modules on a docker config file to use them as separate microservices
